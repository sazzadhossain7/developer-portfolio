            <p>You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings, and stopping trains.
                But nobody pays me a dime for that work. 
                That's why I am learning and mastering web development.
                I will not stop until I become the Web Development Hero.</p>

            They didn't offer me a job. 
            But I made myself as a remove web developer.
             I made their website and showed it to them. 
            They liked it. And uploaded the content. 
            It was fun working at Programming Hero.
